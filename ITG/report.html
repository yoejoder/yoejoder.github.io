        <h2>Live Performances in Boulder & New York City</h2>
        <h3>BOULDER:</h3>
        <img src="/ITG/poster_v5(withCOB).png" alt="Climate Comedy 2024 Poster" class="poster1">
        <p>Having nearly burst the seams of the CU’s Old Main Theatre in 2023, this year’s Stand Up for Climate Comedy event was presented at the historic Boulder Theater April 14, 2024, featuring the stand-up comedy of Chuck Nice, Rollie Williams, Kasha Patel, and the outstanding talent of the CU undergraduate students of the CU course Creative Climate Communication (taught by Beth Osnes, Max Boykoff, and Ben Stasny) with approximately 450 people attending, available online on our Climate Comedy YouTube Channel - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QshK_XuGUMg&t=125s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QshK_XuGUMg&t=125s</a>.</p>
        <p>Chuck Nice (NYC actor, comedian, and long-time ITG partner in all things climate comedy, co-host on Neil deGrasse Tyson’s StarTalk) emceed the show and performed the anchor performance of stand-up. Kasha Patel (science editor at The Washington Post and DC science comedian) and Rollie Williams (YouTube’s Climate Town and graduate degree from Columbia University in climate science) masterfully integrated climate into their hilarious comedy sets. Students held their own among professional comedians with their sketch comedy and stand-up. The community was out in full force supporting this event, with Boulder’s mayor, Boulder’s chief of sustainability, and the director of CU’s Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Science all joining the stage to introduce our invited NYC and DC guests. Something akin to magic happened in that packed theatre that night. A sea of smiling faces all broke into involuntary and uproarious laughter in delight over the fresh and ingenious perspectives on climate issues being performed. Nearly 500 people shared elated emotions together while engaging with the issue of climate in productive and collective ways. Where else does that happen? The students shared a sense of community, achievement, and pride that they will carry with them forever and will weave into their future lives and work.</p>

        <h3>NEW YORK CITY:</h3>
        <img src="/ITG/NYC show.jpg" alt="NYC show Poster" class="poster2">
        <p><strong>How to Survive An APOCALYPSE</strong> produced and hosted Kyle Marian (comedian, Associated Press science journalist) at St. Mark’s Comedy Club in Manhattan on May 25th, 2024, featuring Aasif Mandvi (The Daily Show) and Judah Friedlander (30 Rock) along with Kyle Marian, Manolo Moreno, Dominique Nisperos, and Nat Towsen with approximately 65 folks attending, available online on our Climate Comedy YouTube Channel - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aq2CTZXvzU&t=824s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aq2CTZXvzU&t=824s</a>.</p>
        <p>This performance in NYC was a climate comedy experiment combining race and climate through a focus on the Philippines. It was able to attract a great crowd in part by the two headliners—Mandvi and Friedlander-- who joined the show. The Philippines is such an important nation to focus on in regard to climate change since their island nation is among the most vulnerable to a changing climate and since two thirds of all biodiversity on the planet is within the Philippines. Our CU students worked with the Filipino comedians to research climate-related material on the Philippines for inclusion in their pieces. Referred to as a “homework” gig by comedians, this NYC show featured new work developed by the comedians. The NY Filipino-American comedians visited our class via Zoom to meet with student groups in breakout rooms to do the work of a writer’s group, working to “punch up” the stand-up pieces being created by each comedian. Students did research and scouted out topical references for the comedians’ consideration for inclusion.</p>
        <p>We explored climate in the Philippines from an intersectional perspective, including impacts such as colonization, biodiversity, and governmental corruption as all factored into our considerations of climate change and the lived experience of humans and other species on the 7,641 islands that make up the nation called The Philippines. The timing of this event capitalized on its proximity to Earth Day and Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month celebrations in May. Dominique was quick to point out the absurdity of predominantly white students researching the Philippines for Filipino artists, and at the same time laughed as she admitted that there was so much she did not previously know and learned from the students’ research that she included into her set and her understanding of how climate change was influencing her country of origin. The entire experience was an expansion of what forms allyship can take in greenlighting important human rights issues tied to environmental justice. A highlight of the entire experience was a Zoom class with the comedians in which Kyle and Dominique pontificated in hilarious eloquence on how they both left graduate school for comedy as a platform (although they both still do work in prestigious science-related fields—Kyle previously for Science Friday and now as an international science editor for Associated Press), since comedy unlike academia, allowed them to show up who they were as women of color and to speak with an honesty not afforded them otherwise.</p>

        <h2>Workshops Led at CU Boulder</h2>
        <h3>Climate Comedy Workshop</h3>
        <p>To make the most of having Chuck, Rollie, and Kasha in Boulder, we hosted a free Climate Comedy Workshop on Sunday April 14, 1:00-2:30 PM, Dance 150, at the CU Campus. Over 60 community members and students gathered to meet our visiting professional comedians, be led by them through experiential exercises specific to climate comedy, and hear their views on how they approached their art, and on why they thought comedy was an effective medium for engaging with the issue of climate change. This workshop is available for viewing and educational use “open source” through our YouTube Climate Comedy channel - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lfoe1EzEloo&t=109s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lfoe1EzEloo&t=109s</a>.</p>

        <h2>Podcast</h2>
        <img src="/ITG/Manolo and Jo.jpg" class="MJ">
        <p>This year marks the 3rd edition of a climate-focused Dr. Gameshow episode hosted by Jo Firestone and Manolo Moreno where they play listener-created climate-focused games with callers from all over the globe. These shows are distributed widely via their platform, Maximum Fun. Whereas last year’s episode featured Manolo as a Henson-style puppet, this year’s masterfully edited edition features ingenious animation between games and the endearing repartee between Firestone, Moreno, and their guests. We credit our sustained partnership with the creators of this show with their continual growth of innovation. A common feature of each episode is the conjuring of an alternative world that is quirky, kind, off-beat, and a welcome landing-pad for the weary. This show feels like a warm pair of socks for your funny bone. It blends one of the most urgent issues in our world today with the most ludicrous games imaginable, resulting in a sort of catapult into release and replenishment.</p>

        <h2>Seed Grants for College and University Climate Comedy Shows</h2>
        <p>This was the first year that we reached out to college and university improvisation and comedy groups to offer our $1000 Seed Grant Invitation. This first year we did our research and generated a list of existing programs. We were fortunate to have two groups take up this challenge, and we look forward to continuing this effort with examples to share to those new to our efforts.</p>
        <p><strong>University of North Carolina False Profits:</strong> The UNC student comedy group, False Profits, received a Seed Grant to present a climate-themed performance on April 26, 2024 at the Hanes Art Center for a sold out show (if a free show can be sold out) with over 100 folks attending.</p>
        <p><strong>The University of Colorado Left Right Tim:</strong> CU student comedy group, Left Right Tim, presented a climate-themed performance on April 5th Friday at 8:30 PM in Hale 270 at CU for a crowd of approximately 75 folks. The sketch comedy on climate-anxiety kept the crowd laughing and nodding their heads in knowing recognition. In their own words, they reported “Our comedy style is based around world building, creating believable characters, and highlighting different forms of comedy with our team! We believe were able to incorporate the values of the In the Greenhouse Climate Comedy event into our show and bring attention to the negative effects of climate change in a positive way.”</p>

        <p><strong>James Anders:</strong> Climate comedy can penetrate noise and clutter of modern culture. It allows people to digest a generally negative topic in a revamped, positive manner. As long as it’s funny, which everyone was in their own beautiful way, people will engage with it. I know in my heart that the audience had an incredible time and left the building feeling better about climate change and knew more about it as well. This is the nature of climate comedy; Understanding that people want to be entertained, but also knowing how crucial it is for everyone to understand climate change and the effect it will have on our near future if we do not act immediately. When both of these ideas are considered, you combine the two, giving you climate comedy.</p>
        <p><strong>Mariah Rosensweig:</strong> Seeing the creative, intelligent and informed professionals tackling this issue in a way I never imagined opened my eyes to the abundance and power of sharing information in a way that appealed to people’s emotions, not from a manipulative standpoint, but from an honest standpoint.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I learned so much from this experience, and I think that has to do with the fact that it was a fully engaged, embodied experience.</li>
            <li>Comedy is performative in a different way than just playing a character because you have to be more in tune with yourself and your voice, which for me was terrifying. After all, I realized (again) how powerful my voice is in creating change. Realizing this capability and power is something I’m still working with.</li>
            <li>Throughout the duration of working on the comedy show, my climate anxiety was redirected to nurturing community instead of worrying about the future. I got to witness how much support comes from community, and to be so held by my peers in the process of creating the show.</li>

        <p><strong>Kat Avedovech:</strong> I was particularly inspired by the confidence of the New York comedians. Observing and listening to them taught me not to take myself too seriously and to perform on stage with confidence— in other words, to "commit to the bit."</p>
        <p><strong>Sophie Kvaratskhelia:</strong> Comedy is not one-sided, but rather a conversation between the comedian and the audience that occurs in real time. Having this conversation about climate change and the ways to take action is vital for educating people about the issue and empowering them to do something about it in their everyday lives. Overall, I feel very empowered and more confident in my ability to tackle challenges and daunting tasks that I encounter in the future.</p>
        <p><strong>Claire Grossman:</strong> Climate change is a source of significant anxiety for many. Collaborating with so many people on this project made me feel less alone with my feelings towards climate change and I believe the people we’ve reached through our work and our show as well became a place where people felt connected and empowered through their beliefs. Finding a community like this helps reduce feelings of isolation. Knowing that others share similar anxieties can make individuals feel less alone and more supported. Comedy has the power to reframe issues. By laughing at the absurdities of situations or highlighting the ironies of ineffective actions, comedy can change how the problems are viewed, reducing feeling overwhelmed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating or performing climate comedy can empower individuals by turning passive anxiety into active engagement. Crafting jokes or narratives encourages individuals to take control over how they interact with the subject of climate change.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Serafina Scalo:</strong> I think climate comedy can create positive social change simply by normalizing a culture where the climate crisis and social change is talked about in many spaces, where it is normalized for that to be something we discuss hanging out with friends, with co-workers, see in film and movies – not just a subject for the classroom or the news.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I think it helped me realize that I am more capable of stepping outside of my comfort zone than I thought. This helped me deal not just with anxiety around comedy, but also climate anxiety, through realizing that I AM capable of doing the often hard, overwhelming, and complex work of communicating around climate change through art. This experience gave me trust in my ability to adapt to new challenges and situations, and inspired me through seeing how many other people also care about climate communication.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Oliver Szabo:</strong> Emotionally, creating good-natured comedy made me excited for a future where I could see more of this type of radical punching up being done, and every single art form becoming used to promote political change. Producing the show made me realize that it's not very hard to spread the word- all it takes is a classroom full of people who care.</p>

        <h2>In Closing</h2>
        <p>It is well understood that timing matters in performing comedy. In the case of climate comedy, timing is not only in relation to comic timing so much as the time we have left to solve the climate crisis. To lose another endangered species, or to become one ourselves as homo sapiens, is indeed a looming tragedy. The difference between tragedy and comedy is all in the timing. A tragedy is a story in which it is too late to save the day. Unthinkable grief is released when the characters are unable to avert human-caused disaster. In a comedy, some often preposterous idea is put into action that turns the results of human stupidity around and brings a happy ending. The story of now is leading us and other species towards a tragic ending. If we don’t want that, then the time to feel, care, engage, be happy, joke, laugh, and act is now. We have a good natured and audacious way to tell our human story to turn around a culture so deeply embedded in fossil fuel consumption, capitalism, and patriarchy. Given the weight of these obstacles, climate comedy is a buoyant and preposterous undertaking-- and just in time-- to turn this story around and save the day.</p>
