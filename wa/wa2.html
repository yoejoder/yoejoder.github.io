        <h1>HELLO, WORLD</h1>
        <p> Hi my name is <a href="img/flex.jpg"> Joe Yoder</a> My pronouns are he/him.
            My goals in Web are to try really hard and make good enough content that 
            I can add to my portfolio. I have many hobbies, some include: climbing, working out
            rubick's cube, skiing and video editing. </p>
